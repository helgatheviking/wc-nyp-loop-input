### What's This?

Experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Name Your Price](https://woocommerce.com/products/name-your-price//) that adds Name Your Price inputs to the shop loop.

### Usage

There is nothing to configure. Activating the plugin automatically adds a link in the cart for products that are Name Your Price-enabled. Currently only tested against Simple products and Subscription products. More complex types such as Product Bundles, Mix and Match, etc... or any types that require configuration may not work.

### Important

1. Requires Name Your Price 3.0+
2. This is provided as is and does not receive priority support.
3. Please test thoroughly before using in production.
